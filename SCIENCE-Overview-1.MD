» Overview

1. **Plate Tectonic Theory:** This theory explains the movement of Earth's lithospheric plates. Active volcanoes, earthquake epicenters, and major mountain belts are often found at plate boundaries. Volcanoes are commonly associated with subduction zones, while earthquakes occur along transform faults and convergent boundaries. Major mountain belts are typically formed at convergent boundaries.

2. **Different Plate Boundaries:** There are three main types of plate boundaries:
   - **Divergent Boundaries:** Plates move apart, creating new crust. This occurs at mid-ocean ridges and rift valleys.
   - **Convergent Boundaries:** Plates move towards each other, leading to collision or subduction. Subduction zones and mountain-building are common at convergent boundaries.
   - **Transform Boundaries:** Plates slide past each other horizontally. This results in lateral motion along strike-slip faults.

3. **Processes at Plate Boundaries:** Various processes occur at plate boundaries, including subduction, seafloor spreading, volcanic activity, mountain formation, and the release of seismic energy through earthquakes.

4. **Causes of Plate Movement:** Plate movement is primarily driven by the convective flow of material in the Earth's mantle. Heat from the Earth's interior causes the mantle to circulate, driving the motion of tectonic plates.

5. **Evidence Supporting Plate Movement:** Several lines of evidence support the theory of plate tectonics:
   - Fossil evidence of similar organisms on continents that are now separated by oceans.
   - Matching geological features and rock formations on different continents.
   - Distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes along plate boundaries.
   - Paleoclimatic evidence, such as glacial deposits in areas that were once near the equator.
